## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
1. **Enhanced View Structure**: Updated `resources/views/admin/committee/index.blade.php`
   - Converted from simple gray boxes to card-based sections
   - Added proper section IDs for JavaScript targeting
   - Implemented inline edit forms for each section

2. **JavaScript Functionality**: 
   - Section-specific edit/cancel functionality
   - AJAX-based updates without page reload
   - Dynamic field management for arrays and key-value pairs

   - Improved validation for different section types
   - Maintained backward compatibility

2. **Data Structure**:

   - Responsibilities stored as indexed array
   - Contact info stored as structured object

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Basic content display in simple gray boxes
- Required navigation to separate edit page for any changes
- Limited visual feedback during operations
- Static form fields for term information

### After
- Rich, card-based content display with proper visual hierarchy
- Inline editing for all sections without page navigation
- Real-time feedback with loading states and notifications
- Dynamic field management for flexible content structure
- Consistent design language with about page module

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Functionality Testing**:
   - Test each section's inline editing capability
   - Verify dynamic field addition/removal
   - Test form validation and error handling
   - Verify AJAX updates work correctly

2. **UI/UX Testing**:
   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Test visual consistency with about page
   - Verify loading states and notifications
   - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility

3. **Data Integrity Testing**:
   - Verify term-info key-value pairs save correctly
   - Test array filtering for empty values
   - Verify contact info structure is maintained
   - Test edge cases with special characters

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Add ability to reorder responsibilities
2. **Rich Text Editing**: Implement WYSIWYG editor for description field
3. **Image Management**: Add inline image editing for banner
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add bulk edit capabilities for multiple sections
5. **Version History**: Track changes and provide rollback functionality

## Files Modified

1. `resources/views/admin/committee/index.blade.php` - Main implementation
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CommitteeContentController.php` - Backend logic
3. `routes/web.php` - Route already existed
4. `resources/views/admin/committee/edit.blade.php` - Already well-implemented

## Conclusion

The committee page module now has full parity with the about page module in terms of inline editing functionality. The implementation maintains consistency in design, user experience, and technical architecture while providing administrators with efficient content management capabilities.
